# AI PROMPTING SYSTEM

## How the AI Suggests Scenarios

### On Profile Setup / Periodically

The AI asks (conversationally, not like a form):

1. **Age** — "How old are you?" (determines life stage)
2. **Life Context** — "What's going on in your life right now?"
   - School, work, relationships status
   - Living situation
   - Major life events
3. **What's Hard** — "What conversations are you dreading or avoiding?"

### Proactive Suggestions

Based on age + context, AI might say:

*For a 14-year-old:*
> "Hey — a lot of people your age find it hard to talk to parents about wanting more freedom. Want to practice that conversation?"

*For a 25-year-old:*
> "It sounds like work has been stressful. Have you had to have any hard conversations with your boss? We could practice that."

*For a 45-year-old:*
> "You mentioned your mom's health. A lot of people find it hard to talk to aging parents about driving or moving. Is that coming up for you?"

### The Top 1000 Prompt

When a user isn't sure what to practice, AI offers:

> "Here are the conversations people your age practice most. Want to try one?"

Then shows top 10-20 relevant scenarios with brief descriptions.

User can also ask: "What do people my age usually struggle with?" and get the list.

### Tracking & Adaptation

The system tracks:
- What scenarios they've practiced
- What they're avoiding
- Where they struggled or improved
- Life events they've mentioned

And adapts suggestions accordingly:
- Don't keep suggesting what they've mastered
- Gently re-offer what they avoided
- Connect current events to relevant practice

# FEEDBACK FRAMEWORK

5. **Connect to real life** — "How might this help with [their situation]?"
